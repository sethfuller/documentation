# Rapid Application Development (RAD)

This is a frequently asked job interview. Various phases of RAD mode are:

    - Business Modeling: Based on the flow of information and distribution between various business channels, the product is designed.
    - Data Modeling: The information collected from business modeling is refined into a set of data objects that are significant for the business.
    - Application Generation: Automated tools are used for the construction of the software, to convert process and data models into prototypes

## What is RAD
RAD or Rapid Application Development process is an adoption of the waterfall model; it targets developing software in a short period. RAD follow the iterative

SDLC RAD model has the following phases:

    - Business Modeling
    - Data Modeling
    - Process Modeling
    - Application Generation
    - Testing and Turnover
